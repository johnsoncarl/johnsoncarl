### Hey visitor ðŸ‘‹
# Aman here.

## I am an Aspiring Product Manager.

Having an extremely diverse work history and a love for TECHNOLOGY:computer:, this is what I can come up with. Product roles are the center of everything that gives the value to human life. I am just preparing myself the best I can to get into the field and yeah, I am a damn hard-worker!

And yeah, I believe Blockchain is changing the Internet we'll be using in the future. So, I am a big fan.

As a team player:
- I can **strategize the flow and work of your next app**ðŸŒ±
- and, if you want, **I can fix your code** ðŸ’¬
- I can help you with your next **College Research**ðŸ”­
- and could even design **beautiful UI, posters and Presentations**ðŸ˜„ :art:
- I :heart: love my critics...
